# Project Title

Welcome to the Training and Placement Portal for Birla Institute of Technology Mesra! This portal is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for students to manage their profiles, academic information, calculate their CGPA, view placement statistics, stay updated with placement notifications, and increase productivity through a to-do list feature.

## Features

- Secure Authentication: The portal ensures top-notch security with secure authentication mechanisms. Authentication is done using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, which provides a stateless and secure method for user authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access and modify their data.

- Hashed Passwords: The portal implements advanced hashing algorithms to secure user passwords. When a user creates an account or updates their password, the password is hashed using a strong hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2. This ensures that even in the unlikely event of a data breach, user passwords remain secure and protected.

- Profile Management: Upon logging in, students can update their profiles, providing essential information such as personal details, contact information, and career preferences.

- Academics Section: Students can enter their academic information, including subjects, grades, and credit hours. The portal utilizes this data to calculate the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) automatically.

- CGPA Calculation: The portal offers an automatic CGPA calculation feature, which eliminates the need for manual calculations. Students can quickly obtain their CGPA based on the provided academic information.

- Graphical CGPA Representation: To provide a visual representation of the CGPA, the portal integrates the Chart.js library. Students can view their CGPA in graphical form, allowing for a better understanding and tracking of academic progress.

- Placement Stats Section: The portal provides access to placement statistics, giving students insights into the previous placement records. This information can be valuable when making informed decisions about career paths and job opportunities.

- Placement Notifications: Students can stay up-to-date with the latest placement notifications through the portal. This feature ensures that students never miss any important announcements or opportunities.

- Productivity-Boosting To-Do List: The portal includes a beautifully designed to-do list feature that helps students increase their productivity. They can create tasks, set deadlines, and mark tasks as complete, allowing them to organize their work efficiently.
